# TradeXP - Trading Simulation (Beta)

TradeXP is an interactive **trading simulation** that allows users to experience the **stock market mechanics** through a simple Python-based model. This simulation enables users to borrow, buy, sell, and return stocks while keeping track of stock prices and personal finances.

## Features:

✅ **Live Stock Tracking** – Monitor company stock availability and current stock price.  
✅ **Borrowing & Returning Stocks** – Experience short selling mechanics by borrowing and returning stocks.  
✅ **Buying & Selling** – Trade stocks based on the changing market price.  
✅ **Dynamic Market Conditions** – Adjust stock prices to simulate real market fluctuations.

## How It Works:

1.  **Start with $0 and 0 stocks.**
    
2.  **Borrow stocks from the company** if needed.
    
3.  **Sell stocks to earn money** at the current market price.
    
4.  **Buy stocks when the price drops** to maximize profits.
    
5.  **Return borrowed stocks** when necessary.

## Example Simulation:

*   Borrow 1 stock  
*   Sell it at **$100**  
*   Market price drops to **$60**  
*   Buy it back at a lower price  
*   Return the borrowed stock for a profit
